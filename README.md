* Find vulnerabilities / exploits to gain access to a vulnerable WordPress site / server.
+ Use Wireshark to analyze and find malicious traffic on the wire.
- Create a team presentation with the assessment, analysis and hardening of the vulnerable system.

#### Read through the [RedTeam](https://github.com/mhighbe-20/Cybersecurity_Final_Project/blob/main/RedTeam.md), [BlueTeam](https://github.com/mhighbe-20/Cybersecurity_Final_Project/blob/main/Blueteam.md) files to see the work, processes, and findings that lead up to the final presentation.

_Note_: This presentation was created as a group with classmates. The underlying documentation for RedTeam and BluTeam Analysis was my own personal work. We were assigned to as a Team to bring our findings together and present together as a team on the final day of our Cybersecurity Bootcamp. - illustrating the ability to work independently as well as being a contributing Team member.
